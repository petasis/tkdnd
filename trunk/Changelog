        * library/tkdnd_unix.tcl:
        * library/tkdnd_windows.tcl: Fixed bug 2169256.

        * library/tkdnd.tcl: Fixed bug 2486830.

2010-06-16  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
        TkDND 2.2 released.
	* Makefile.in:
	* configure.in:
	* win/Makefile:
	* win/TkDND_OleDND.cpp:
	* unix/TkDND_XDND.c: Applied a patch from Andreas Kupries, which
	make the unix code compatible with compilers supporting C89 (i.e.
	AIX's cc). Also, the TEA files were updated.

	* /unix/TkDND_XDND.c: Fixed a bug in TkDND_RegisterTypesObjCmd.
	It seems that KDE wants the XdndAware property on the window these
	days, and not at the toplevel one.

2010-06-11  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
        TkDND 2.1 released.

2010-05-05  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
        * /macosx/macdnd.m: Several fixes. The most important are:
        Do not initiate a drag if the clipboard is empty (i.e. because we
          cannot handle any of the provided types).
        Fixed drag icon slide when the drag is canceled.

2010-04-30  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
        * /macosx/macdnd.m: Several changes:
        Moved drag operation inside TkDND_DoDragDropObjCmd. This means that
          drag operation can be started with a Tk binding.
        Fixed the way drag types are declared in the drag clipboard. Now types
          are reported correctly during drops.
        Added a tag in the DNDView class.
        Added a function to get the DNDView pointer from an NSView pointer.
          Hopefully this will not permit to add more than one DNDView to any
          view. This function always return a DNDView pointer (it creates a
          new DNDView if a view does not already has one).

        The demos seem to work, although the garbage collector seems to print
        some messages during drags from Tk windows.

2010-04-06  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
        * /macosx/macdnd.m: Some attempts towards drag support for OS X.

2010-01-03  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
        * /library/tkdnd_macosx.tcl:
        * /macosx/macdnd.m: Changed the way dropped data is handled: during
        the drop event the data are converted into a utf-8 string (in case of
        dropping string data) or a Tcl list object of utf-8 filenames (in case
        of dropping files). The data object is stored directly in the 
        tkdnd::macdnd::_dropped_data variable, instead of the selection
        clipboard. _GetDroppedData was modified to return this stored data.

2009-12-30  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
        * /cmake:
        * /CMakeLists.txt: Added support for building TkDND with cmake (i.e.
        under windows).

2009-12-29  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
        * /library/tkdnd_macosx.tcl:
        * /macosx/macdnd.m: Changes to better integrate the work done by
        Kevin Walzer with the rest of TkDND, since OS X seems to mimic the
        XDND implementation. tkdnd_macosx.tcl is now a stub file, with most of
        the work being done by the unix (XDND) code.
        I think that OS X drop support is now working.

2009-12-09  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
        * /library/tkdnd_macosx.tcl:
        * /macosx/macdnd.m: Updates to better integrate the OS X type
        registration command with the rest of the TkDND internal API.

2009-12-01  Walzer Kevin    <kw@codebykevin.com>
        * /macosx/*: Initial support for drop targets under OS X (Cocoa).

2007-02-09  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
        * /unix/TkDND_XDND.c: Fixed a bug in TkDND_RegisterTypesObjCmd, where
        Tk_Parent was used to determine if a provided path was a toplevel.
        Replaced by a check through Tk_IsTopLevel.
        Bug reported by Alain Bertrand <alain.mp.bertrand@tele2.be>

2006-04-24  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
        * TkDND version 2.0 started.
