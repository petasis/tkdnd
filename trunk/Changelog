        * /library/tkdnd_macosx.tcl:
        * /macosx/macdnd.m: Changes to better integrate the work done by
        Kevin Walzer with the rest of TkDND, since OS X seems to mimic the
        XDND implementation. tkdnd_macosx.tcl is now a stub file, with most of
        the work being done by the unix (XDND) code.
        I think that OS X drop support is now working.

        * /library/tkdnd_macosx.tcl:
        * /macosx/macdnd.m: Updates to better integrate the OS X type
        registration command with the rest of the TkDND internal API.

        * /macosx/*: Initial support for drop targets under OS X (Cocoa).

        * /unix/TkDND_XDND.c: Fixed a bug in TkDND_RegisterTypesObjCmd, where
        Tk_Parent was used to determine if a provided path was a toplevel.
        Replaced by a check through Tk_IsTopLevel.
        Bug reported by Alain Bertrand <alain.mp.bertrand@tele2.be>
