	* library/tkdnd_unix.tcl:
	* library/tkdnd_windows.tcl: Leave and Drop events do not report 0
        as root x/y (%X %Y). In case the underlying protocol does not support
        reporting the mouse coordinates for the specific event, the last known
        possition from the position event is used.

2012-08-26  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
	TkDND 2.6 released.
	* unix/tkUnixSelect.c: Added a work-around for getting the selection
	under unix: since Tk does not always deliver SelectionNotify, we try
	to get the selection even if SelectionNotify has not been received.

2012-08-15  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
	* unix/tkUnixSelect.c: Partially solved the problem with getting
	selection under unix. The solution was to try and get the selection,
	even if a SelectionNotify event has not been delivered.

2012-07-14  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
	* unix/tkUnixSelect.c: Tests with Tcl_ThreadAlert(). It helps
	somewhat, but is not the solution for the problems when getting the
	selection.

2012-06-17  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
	TkDND 2.5 released.
	* win/TkDND_OleDND.cpp: Fixes for type CF_HDROP.

2012-06-07  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
	* demos/basic.tcl: Updated demo with support for colours, which only
	works for XDND right now.

	* unix/TkDND_XDND.c:
	* unix/tkUnixSelect.c: Implementation of unix (XDND) drags completed.

2012-06-06  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
	* unix/Cursors.c: Ported cursors from TkDND 1.x to TkDND 2.x

2012-06-05  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
	* library/tkdnd.tcl:
	* library/tkdnd_unix.tcl:
	* unix/tkUnixSelect.c:
	* unix/TkDND_XDND.c: Added support for initiating drags from Tk under
	unix. Despite incomplete, seems to work with GTK.

2012-06-02  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
	* library/tkdnd_unix.tcl:
	* unix/TkDND_XDND.c:
	* unix/tkUnixSelect.c:
	* unix/tkSelect.h: Modifications to support Linux drops. Drops from
	GTK seem to always work, and drops from Qt seem to work most of the
	times.

2012-04-19  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
	* win/Makefile: Updated the Windows Makefile, after a patch from
	Dave Bodenstab.

2012-04-12  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
	TkDND 2.4 released.
	* library/tkdnd_unix.tcl:
	* unix/TkDND_XDND.c:
	* unix/tkUnixSelect.c:
	* unix/tkSelect.h: Modifications to support Linux drops.

	* tclconfig/*:
	* configure.in, Makefile.in: Updated to TEA 3.9.

	* library/tkdnd_unix.tcl: Removed braces from a comment in
	xdnd::_GetDroppedData, left from testing with TIP 370 preliminary
	implementation. SF Bug ID: 3516862

2012-03-03  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
	TkDND 2.3 released.
	* library/tkdnd_windows.tcl:
	* win/OleDND.h:
	* win/TkDND_OleDND.cpp: Fix in TkDND_DropSource::QueryContinueDrag,
	to support dragging with all mouse buttons. Bug reported by
	Michael Fersch.

2011-09-24  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
	* win/OleDND.h: Added definition of WINVER to version 5, when compiling
	with MinGW, which defines it with version 4. SF Bug ID: 3411338.

2011-09-23  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
	* win/OleDND.h: Modified STRING_(s), to ease compilation with MinGW.
	Patch provided by Hans-Christoph Steiner. SF Bug ID: 3411338.

2011-09-22  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
	* win/OleDND.h: Added a check if CF_DIBV5 is defined (i.e.
	WINVER < 0x0500). SF Bug ID: 3411338.

2011-03-18  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
	* library/tkdnd_unix.tcl: Fixed a bug in xdnd::_GetDroppedData, where
	an improper error was thrown in case no common types were found between
	the drag source and drop target widgets. Now a more appropriate error
	is returned. Bug reported by Kevin Walzer.

2011-01-14  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
	* library/tkdnd_unix.tcl: Added support for accepting drops, if
	TIP 370 is finally approved. Changes tested with a preliminary TIP 370
	implementation.

	* library/tkdnd_macosx.tcl: Fixed a bug reported by Kevin Walzer:
	macdnd::_GetDroppedData and xdnd::_GetDroppedData were missing the
	"time" argument, added in the XDND section for TIP 370 (if it gets
	accepted).

	* macosx/macdnd.m: Restored back a workarround by Kevin Walzer, as
	TkDND does not work well under all circumstances in OS X 10.6.
	(Reported by Kevin Walzer on 23 Dec 2010).

2010-08-03  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
	TkDND 2.2 released.
	* library/tkdnd_windows.tcl:
	* win/OleDND.h: Fixes for compiling with UNICODE & _UNICODE.

2010-07-28  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
	* win/Makefile: Updated.

	* library/tkdnd_unix.tcl:
	* library/tkdnd_windows.tcl: Fixed bug 2169256.

	* library/tkdnd.tcl: Fixed bug 2486830.

2010-06-16  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
	* Makefile.in:
	* configure.in:
	* win/Makefile:
	* win/TkDND_OleDND.cpp:
	* unix/TkDND_XDND.c: Applied a patch from Andreas Kupries, which
	make the unix code compatible with compilers supporting C89 (i.e.
	AIX's cc). Also, the TEA files were updated.

	* /unix/TkDND_XDND.c: Fixed a bug in TkDND_RegisterTypesObjCmd.
	It seems that KDE wants the XdndAware property on the window these
	days, and not at the toplevel one.

2010-06-11  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
	TkDND 2.1 released.

2010-05-05  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
	* /macosx/macdnd.m: Several fixes. The most important are:
	Do not initiate a drag if the clipboard is empty (i.e. because we
	  cannot handle any of the provided types).
	Fixed drag icon slide when the drag is canceled.

2010-04-30  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
	* /macosx/macdnd.m: Several changes:
	Moved drag operation inside TkDND_DoDragDropObjCmd. This means that
	  drag operation can be started with a Tk binding.
	Fixed the way drag types are declared in the drag clipboard. Now types
	  are reported correctly during drops.
	Added a tag in the DNDView class.
	Added a function to get the DNDView pointer from an NSView pointer.
	  Hopefully this will not permit to add more than one DNDView to any
	  view. This function always return a DNDView pointer (it creates a
	  new DNDView if a view does not already has one).

	The demos seem to work, although the garbage collector seems to print
	some messages during drags from Tk windows.

2010-04-06  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
	* /macosx/macdnd.m: Some attempts towards drag support for OS X.

2010-01-03  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
	* /library/tkdnd_macosx.tcl:
	* /macosx/macdnd.m: Changed the way dropped data is handled: during
	the drop event the data are converted into a utf-8 string (in case of
	dropping string data) or a Tcl list object of utf-8 filenames (in case
	of dropping files). The data object is stored directly in the
	tkdnd::macdnd::_dropped_data variable, instead of the selection
	clipboard. _GetDroppedData was modified to return this stored data.

2009-12-30  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
	* /cmake:
	* /CMakeLists.txt: Added support for building TkDND with cmake (i.e.
	under windows).

2009-12-29  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
	* /library/tkdnd_macosx.tcl:
	* /macosx/macdnd.m: Changes to better integrate the work done by
	Kevin Walzer with the rest of TkDND, since OS X seems to mimic the
	XDND implementation. tkdnd_macosx.tcl is now a stub file, with most of
	the work being done by the unix (XDND) code.
	I think that OS X drop support is now working.

2009-12-09  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
	* /library/tkdnd_macosx.tcl:
	* /macosx/macdnd.m: Updates to better integrate the OS X type
	registration command with the rest of the TkDND internal API.

2009-12-01  Walzer Kevin    <kw@codebykevin.com>
	* /macosx/*: Initial support for drop targets under OS X (Cocoa).

2007-02-09  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
	* /unix/TkDND_XDND.c: Fixed a bug in TkDND_RegisterTypesObjCmd, where
	Tk_Parent was used to determine if a provided path was a toplevel.
	Replaced by a check through Tk_IsTopLevel.
	Bug reported by Alain Bertrand <alain.mp.bertrand@tele2.be>

2006-04-24  Petasis George  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>
	* TkDND version 2.0 started.
